# CS 294 at UC Berkeley: Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repo includes my solutions to the assigments of the UC Berkeley Deep Reinforcement Learning course offered in Fall 2018, taught by Sergey Levine. 

Course URL: http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/ 

Course GitHub: https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework

I would like to thank the instructor and the TAs for making this wonderful course.

## Code structure
- `./hw1/`: contains code for the implementation of **imitation learning**, including direct **behavior cloning** and the **DAgger** algorithm See my report for this homework [here](./hw1/README.md). 
- `./hw2/`: contains code for the implementation of **policy gradient** and its variants, including *variance reduction methods.* See my report for this homework [here](./hw2/README.md).
